This is my first attempt in creating my own personal blog/website, normally I do this sort of things for others. The opportunity arose while testing out some static site generators like [Hugo](http://gohugo.io), which is what is used to create this website.

My day-to-day routine involves developing websites and web-based applications primarily using [Django](http://djangoproject.com).
